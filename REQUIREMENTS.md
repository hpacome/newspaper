# requirements documents

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the implementation of a simple application that primarly create a database schema with a robust security checks.
Additionally, it will implement C# .net unit to validate the requirement.

## User Story 1 :
As a database administrator, I want to create a table named t_author with the following properties:

1. id: A universally unique identifier (UUID) that cannot be null and serves as the primary key of the table.
2. name: A string property with a maximum length of 255 characters, which cannot be null.
3. email: A string property with a maximum length of 255 characters, which cannot be null.

Additionally, I want to ensure that:
- The id property is set as the primary key of the table.
- The id property cannot be an empty UUID.

This table will allow us to store information about authors, including their name and email address, while ensuring data integrity and uniqueness.

## User Story 2 :
As a developer, I want to implement a C# project named newsletter.repository that provides functionality to interact with a database table named t_author. This project should include the following features:

1. Insert an author into the t_author table: As a user of the newsletter.repository, I want to be able to add a new author to the t_author table in the database. This feature should allow me to provide the necessary information for the new author, such as their name, email address, and any other relevant details.

2. Update an author in the t_author table: As a user of the newsletter.repository, I want to be able to update the information of an existing author in the t_author table. This feature should allow me to modify the author's details, such as their name, email address, or any other relevant information.

3. Delete an author from the t_author table: As a user of the newsletter.repository, I want to be able to delete an existing author from the t_author table. This feature should allow me to specify the author to be deleted based on their unique identifier, such as their id or email address.

4. Get an author from the t_author table: As a user of the newsletter.repository, I want to be able to retrieve the information of a specific author from the t_author table. This feature should allow me to search for an author based on their unique identifier, such as their id or email address, and return their details.

These features will enable users of the newsletter.repository to effectively manage authors in the database and perform essential CRUD operations with ease.
